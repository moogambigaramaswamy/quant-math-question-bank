@title Quantitative Aptitude – Numbers and Operations Assessment
@description Assessment covering problem-solving skills in Numbers and Operations, focusing on Simple Interest and Time & Work problems.

// Question 1
@question A person invests ₹12,000 in a fixed deposit scheme at a simple interest rate of \( 6\% \) per annum for 2 years. The total amount is then reinvested at \( 8\% \) per annum for 3 more years. What is the final amount after the second investment?
@instruction Select the correct answer.

@option ₹16,560.00
@option ₹16,640.00
@@option ₹16,665.60
@option ₹16,720.00
@explanation 
First investment: \(\text{SI}_1=\dfrac{12000\times 6\times 2}{100}=₹1,440\). Amount after 2 years \(A_1=12000+1440=₹13,440\).  
Second investment: \(\text{SI}_2=\dfrac{13{,}440\times 8\times 3}{100}=₹3,225.60\). Final amount \(=13{,}440+3{,}225.60=₹16,665.60\).

// Question 2
@question Three pipes can fill a tank in 10 hours, 15 hours, and 20 hours respectively. All three pipes are opened together for 2 hours, after which the fastest pipe (10-hour) is closed. The remaining two pipes continue until the tank is full. What is the total time taken to fill the tank?
@instruction Select the correct answer.

@option \(6\frac{5}{6}\) hours
@option \(6\frac{4}{5}\) hours

@option \(7\frac{1}{6}\) hours
@explanation 
Rates: \(r_1=\tfrac{1}{10},\ r_2=\tfrac{1}{15},\ r_3=\tfrac{1}{20}\). Combined rate \(=\tfrac{13}{60}\) tank/hr. Work in first 2 hrs \(=2\times\tfrac{13}{60}=\tfrac{13}{30}\). Remaining \(=1-\tfrac{13}{30}=\tfrac{17}{30}\). Remaining two pipes rate \(=\tfrac{1}{15}+\tfrac{1}{20}=\tfrac{7}{60}\). Time to finish \(=\dfrac{\tfrac{17}{30}}{\tfrac{7}{60}}=\dfrac{34}{7}\) hrs \(=4\frac{6}{7}\) hrs. Total time \(=2+\dfrac{34}{7}=\dfrac{48}{7}\) hrs \(=6\frac{6}{7}\) hrs.
